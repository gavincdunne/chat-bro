# 🤖 ChatBro – Mental Health for the Modern Man
*Built with ❤️ by WeekendWare*

ChatBro is a Kotlin Android app designed to help young men navigate their mental health in a way that’s approachable, smart, and stigma-free. It's like a therapist... if your therapist also knew how to use emojis and never judged you for eating cold pizza at 2am.

## 🧠 What It Does

ChatBro is your mobile wingman for emotional self-awareness:

- ✅ Emoji-based mood check-ins
- 📝 Daily journaling (optional, but cathartic)
- 📈 Mood tracking (because feelings are data too)
- 🧩 AI-ready architecture for future chat-based support
- 💬 Built using modern Android tech for a buttery-smooth experience


## 🧩 What’s Coming Next

We’ve set the foundation for a solid MVP, but this bro isn’t done evolving yet:

- 🔮 **AI-powered journaling feedback** (OpenAI/Gemini integration)
- 🗓 **Mood history and trend analysis**
- 🔔 **Push notifications** for regular check-ins
- 🗣️ **Voice-based entries and tone detection**
- 🤖 **Customizable avatars** for your ChatBro personality**


## 🐣 Why ChatBro?

Because even strong, silent types need to vent sometimes.  
And let’s be honest—your group chat isn’t cutting it.
